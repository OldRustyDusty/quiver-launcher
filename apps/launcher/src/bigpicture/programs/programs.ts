 *   3. the catalog's Windows names without ".exe": Star Fox Enhanced names
 *      starfox_pc.exe, and its Linux build has starfox_pc.
 * When none of them is a program in the folder and it has more than one,
 * the player picks, and that's remembered (bigpicture.json).
 *
 * On Windows the player picks only when upstream would be guessing: several
 * programs side by side (src-tauri/src/bigpicture/programs.rs), as in
 * Bloodborne's Windows port, whose first program is a GPU check.
